The popover element is used to display content in a popover that appears in the top-layer of the page.  
The rest of the page can still be interacted with - meaning it is not a modal.

<Popover />

You can create a popover by simply addidng the `popover` attribute to an element.

```html
<div popover id="pop-1">Open Popover</div>
```

The popover is set to 'display: none' by default.  
To open the popover, you can do it decalaratively via popovertaget atttribute.

```html
<button popovertarget="pop-1">Open Popover</button>
```

Or via JavaScript.

```js
document.querySelector('div#pop-1').togglePopover()
```
