The Dialog element is used to display content in a dialog that appears in the top-layer of the page.
Unlike the [popover element](/demoes/popover), which can only be opened as a non-modal, the dialog can be used as a modal or non-modal.

When opening as a model, the rest of the page cannot be interacted with.

<Dialog />

When closing the dialog, you can pass a value in the close() function

```js
dialog.close('hellooooooo')
```

The value can then be picked up by listening for the "close" event and accessing the returnValue property

```js
const favDialog = document.getElementById('favDialog')
dialog.addEventListener('close', () => {
  const value = favDialog.returnValue // "hellooooooo"
})
```
